## Project Description
Everyone nowadays are looking for ways to save money in a world that charges you top price for seemingly everything you do. Unfortunately, eating out is no exception as it happens to be the main thing that empties peoples pockets in this day and age. The simple solution to this problem would be to cook at home more, but a lot of people are either too busy or just don't know how to cook with the ingredients they have in their fridge. Luckily we have created the website MISO HUNGRY to help solve this problem for all the individuals dealing with it. MISO HUNGRY is an application that helps generate recipes based off what the user currently has in their pantry or just dishes the user if currently interested in making. The website returns multiple recipes based off the users preferences and wants and provides the recipe link, ingredients needed, nutritional information, and even a health evaluation to aid those who want to keep a healthy lifestyle. Through this, MISO HUNGRY aims to improve situations for health-conscious individuals, busy students, financially weary people, and home cooks by enhancing mealtime experiences.
